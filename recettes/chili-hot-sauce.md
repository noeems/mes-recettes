# Chili hot sauce

![peppers](../medias/Chilies.jpg)

**Ingredients**  
â€¢ Chilies from the organic farmers market in Stoke Newington, London (are some of these called banana peppers ?) ðŸŒ¶   
â€¢ Two cloves of garlic  
â€¢ Sea salt  
â€¢ Mineral water  

_Notable fact_: Chopped or mashed peppers tend to mold more easily than other fermented vegetables, so I was quite heavy-handed with the salt, in order to make a high concentration brine. [This page](https://www.familyfoodgarden.com/preserve-hot-banana-peppers/) helped me understand proportions a little better.

**Time & place**  
Made: October 5th 2018  
Place: Bordeaux  
Fermentation time : approx. 2-3 weeks before blending

Lovely colors â†“  
The picture is taken before I found the weight to keep the peppers under the brine (so they don't develop mold).
