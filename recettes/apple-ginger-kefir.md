** Ingredients **  
• A Normandy apple, firm  
• Diced organic ginger  
• Second ferment from my water kefir grains  

Proportions: roughly enough for a liter batch, see picture.

** Time **  
Made: August 20th  
_Notable fact_: Cork popped open and lost half of the bottle to a fizz parade! On August 24th. We drank the rest on that same afternoon.
