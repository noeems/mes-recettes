**Ingredients**  
‚Ä¢ A Normandy apple, firm üçé  
‚Ä¢ Diced organic ginger  
‚Ä¢ Cane sugar  
‚Ä¢ Second ferment from my water kefir grains  

Proportions: roughly enough for a liter batch, see picture.

**Time**  
Made: August 20th  

_Notable fact_: Cork popped open and lost half of the bottle to a fizz parade! On August 24th. 
We drank the rest on that same afternoon.
